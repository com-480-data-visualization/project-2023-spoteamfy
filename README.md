## Description of our github repository

In this section, we describe the relevant folders and files for our project.
<br>

**📁 Back[Preprocessing]** : 

&emsp;This folder contains the notebooks and the python files used to preprocess the datas for our visualization. In it, we have two files, **📁 Milestone1** and **📁 Milestone3**, to distinguish the preprocessings done for first milestone and the third milestone. The prepocessing steps consist of cleaning datas, accessing datas using APIs, formatting datas to use them with D3.js, doing statistics on the datas, merging datas,... 

<br>

**📁 src** : 

&emsp;This folder contains all the files and documents used to create the website that supports our visualization. There are datas, images, gifs, Vue and Javascript files. Recall that vue.js is an open-source framework that we use to create our website. The most important files are listed below :

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**📁 src/assets/data** : Contains the datas (.json), the images and the gifs used for the website and the viz.
